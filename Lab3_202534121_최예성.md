# My project plan (Level 1 Heading)

***Note:*** This in document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.

### **Proposal** (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vicion software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko)
or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other opem source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmlab
- package manager

### Installation

In an bash termainal, run the following commands (*Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer*) :

```c
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
